# 📊 Startup Funding Data Cleaning & Analysis

This repository contains a mini data-analytics project focused on cleaning and preprocessing startup funding data.
The goal: transform raw, inconsistent, messy funding dataset into a structured, analysis-ready format.

This is not a machine learning project — it's a data analyst workflow: understanding raw input, cleaning, preprocessing, validating.

✅ Project Objectives
Step	Goal
🧹 Data Cleaning	Handle missing values, inconsistent categories, incorrect formatting, duplicates
🧠 Standardization	Normalize startup names, investor names, funding types, and dates
📁 Export	Produce clean structured dataset ready for analysis or visualization
